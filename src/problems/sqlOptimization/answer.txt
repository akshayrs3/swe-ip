Create an index on the CustomerID and Amount columns. This allows the database engine to quickly identify relevant rows based on these criteria.

CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_CustomerID_Amount ON Orders (CustomerID, Amount);

Benefits:

The optimized query utilizes the index to efficiently locate the desired rows. This dramatically reduces the number of rows scanned, leading to faster query execution times.

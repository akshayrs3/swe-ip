Scenario:

Imagine we have a table named Orders with columns OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, and Amount. We want to find all orders placed by a specific customer with an amount greater than $100.

Original Query:

<pre>
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 1234
AND Amount > 100;
</pre>

This query scans all rows in the Orders table, regardless of the CustomerID or Amount. This is inefficient, especially if the table contains millions of rows.

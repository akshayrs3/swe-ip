This simple Java class demonstrates thread-unsafe access to a counter variable. 

The increment() method increments the counter, but it is not synchronized, allowing race conditions and unexpected behavior when accessed concurrently.


public class Counter {
    private int count;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
